# ADELINK
ADELINK is a mobile app designed to enable anyone to interface with ADELE, the 6-DOF ROS-powered robot designed and built by the SUTD Organization of Autonomous Robotics (SOAR). ADELINK currently supports tele-operation over sockets and upcoming features include a command line interface, live-streaming of the robot's camera feed, and no-code programming!
